The scripts in this directory are meant to serve as initial examples of how to
run communicating Tao-hosted proceses and microservices in a variety of
configurations, including on the local host, on local machines, or on GCE, AWS,
or other cloud platforms.

These scripts are not general-purpose, and will need to be edited heavily to
match the specific deployment configuration. Further documentation and more
general scripts may be added here in the future.
